Used recoil for easy state management/ can be done with redux as well.
Few thoughts I have done -->
- Disabled the next button, if the user hasn't entered any of the fields or any error is there.
- Error message next to the input for better user experience/understanding.
- next button at the bottom for quick reachability.
- the Next, Back , Submit button are at the same place across the form for consistancy.
- Submit button will be enabled only if the user has uploaded/captured image and signature.
- Retry option if the submit action fails(mocked as of now).
- Success page and form clear after succeeding to the last page.
- Page slide animation based on the direction of form.

Steps to start the client:

1. run --> npm install
2. run --> npm start

There you go :)
